## 2. Requirements
In this section, organize and list requirements from *Step 5*.  You are welcome to organize this section in anyway that you would like (using headings or tables).  The structure of this section should correspond to your overview section, and it is recommended that that you review the [lessons learned](../lessonsLearned.md) from your colleagues.

  - Business: The business objective that the system needs to satisfy.
    - B.1 The staff needs to maintain to stay on meal preparation schedule to get things delivered in time for the user.
  - User: The actions that a user takes within the system
    - U.1 The user needs to have given the business the address and/or room number to where they want the order delivered to.
-   Functional: The functions should the system perform
    - F.1 The system should show the progress of the meals being made so the user knows when it is going to arrive.
 - Non-Functional: The characteristics that the system should have.
    - N.1 The app should always be refreshing for the users so it gives real time updates.
- System: Specifications about how the system should be built.
    - S.1 The system must use the on-campus account domain for the on-campus users.


## 3. Assumptions
User will like the frequesnt updates about their meal and delivery

Using Messiah's login will be easier for students to log in
